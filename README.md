Nanoparser - simple library for parsing operator precendence grammar
=========

Nanoparser is simple library solving problem of parsing 
[operator precendence grammars][1] in Java.

There are number number of good compiler generator libraries for Java, such as [ANTLR][2], [jParsec][3] and other.

Why Nanoparser?

 - Nanoparser is a library, not code generator.
 - Nanoparser handles a very narrow, but practically important class of [operator precendence grammars][1],
 - By focusing on single grammar type Nanoparser is far more simple to use.
